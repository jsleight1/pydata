## `pydata`

`pydata` is a python package developed for the analysis and visualisation of 
L-shaped datasets. It can either be installed locally using `poetry` or an 
docker container environment has also be created which can be used for 
development and running the following examples.

`docker run -it docker.io/jsleight1/pydata:3.10-latest`

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pydata.pydata import pydata

x = pydata.example_pydata()

print(x)
print(x.data.head(2))
print(x.description.head(2))
print(x.annotation.head(2))

```

## Linear dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis (PCA).

```{python}

x.compute_pca()

print(x.pcs)

print(x.pcs.data)
print(x.pcs.description.head(2))
print(x.pcs.annotation)
```


## Plotting

```{python}
x.plot(type = "pca", colour_by = "Treatment")
plt.show()

x.plot(type = "violin", colour_by = "Treatment")
plt.show()

x.plot(
    type = "feature_heatmap", 
    annotate_samples_by = ["ID", "Treatment"]
)
plt.show()

x.plot(
    type = "correlation_heatmap", 
    annotate_samples_by = ["ID", "Treatment"]
)
plt.show()

x.plot(type = "density")
plt.show()
```
