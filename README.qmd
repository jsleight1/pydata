## `pydata`

`pydata` is a python package developed for the analysis and visualisation of 
L-shaped datasets. It can either be installed locally using `poetry` or an 
docker container environment has also be created which can be used for 
development and running the following examples.

`docker run -it docker.io/jsleight1/pydata:3.10-latest`

```{python}
from pydata.pydata import pydata

x = pydata.example_pydata()

print(x)
print(x.data.head(2))
print(x.description.head(2))
print(x.annotation.head(2))

```

## Linear dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis (PCA).

```{python}

x.compute_pca()

print(x.pcs)

print(x.pcs.data)
print(x.pcs.description.head(2))
print(x.pcs.annotation)
```


## Plotting

```{python}

# PCA 
x.plot(type = "pca", colour_by = "Treatment")
```
